A Brad Traversy Course on how to build a Django Web app.

You can find his course and many courses via [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/python-django-dev-to-deployment/)
or find many free courses and tutorials on [Yotube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA)

For aspiring Web Developers, I highly recommended his courses.
